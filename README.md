Grave of the Fireflies MiniGames

For my class project we were told to select an old film to communicate its main messages or feelings through a game. I chose Grave of the Fireflies which is a famous Studio Ghibli film.

I wanted to highlight the relationship between Seita and Setsuko and the good times they had together rather than all the struggles which are depicted throughout the movie. The first game is a simple catch the fireflies mini game with calm background music and twinkling particle effects.

The second game I created showed the bond between Seita and Setsuko and how much Setsuko relied on Seita throughout the film. After all of Setsuko's cries, Seita is able to relieve all of her troubles with candy.

Challenges: Capturing a movie's essence in game form and allowing a player to interact more directly with the media. Coming up with multiple ideas instead of just one which are cohesive to the story's theme.

Learned: How to brainstorm a variety of different games. How to create scenes and sprites in Phaser3. How to capture emotion instead of focusing on rigorous or fast paced gameplay mechanics.
